In Bash:

javac Main.java
javac SearchAlgorithms/LinearSearch.java
java Main


These commands are used to compile and run Java programs from the command line. Let's break down each command:

1. javac Main.java

javac stands for Java Compiler. It is the command-line tool used to compile Java source code files (files with a .java extension) into bytecode files (files with a .class extension).
SearchAlgorithms.java is the main Java source code file that contains the main method and the code for the SearchAlgorithms class.
After executing this command, if there are no compilation errors, it will generate a SearchAlgorithms.class file in the same directory.

2. javac SearchAlgorithms/LinearSearch.java

This command is similar to the first one, but it compiles the LinearSearch.java file, which is part of the com.example.search package.
The package structure is reflected in the directory structure (com/example/search), and the compiled file (LinearSearch.class) will be generated in the appropriate package directory.

3. java Main

java is the command used to run Java applications.
SearchAlgorithms is the name of the class that contains the main method. When running a Java program, you specify the class that contains the main method.
This command executes the compiled Java program. It locates the SearchAlgorithms class, loads it into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and runs the main method.

In summary, the first two commands compile the Java source code files (SearchAlgorithms.java and LinearSearch.java), and the third command runs the compiled Java program (SearchAlgorithms).

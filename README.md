<!-- About the Program -->

# Searching Algorithms Java Program

- This Java program implements various search algorithms for finding a target element in a sorted array.
- The program will displays the result of each search algorithm, indicating whether the target element was found and at which index.
- The program is organized with each search algorithm placed in its own class, promoting modularity and readability.
- It demonstrates various techniques for efficient searching in sorted arrays, catering to different scenarios and requirements.
- Here's an overview of the program's structure and functionality:

<!-- The Main Class -->

## Main Class (Main method in the MainProgram Class):

- Contains the main method where the execution starts.
- Creates a sorted array of integers.
- Specifies target elements for each search algorithm.
- Calls each search algorithm with the sorted array and the corresponding target element.
- Displays the original sorted array and the result of each search.

<!-- All Search Algorithm Class -->

#### Search Algorithm Classes:

##### LinearSearch:

- Implements linear search, traversing the array sequentially until the target element is found.

##### BinarySearch:

- Implements binary search, applicable to sorted arrays, dividing the search space in half at each step.

##### HashingSearch:

- Implements a simple hashing search by sequentially checking each element in the array.

##### InterpolationSearch:

- Implements interpolation search, applicable to uniformly distributed sorted arrays, estimating the probable position of the target element.

##### ExponentialSearch:

- Combines binary search and linear search, initially performing binary search with exponentially increasing bounds.

##### JumpSearch:

- Implements jump search, requiring a sorted array, jumping a fixed number of steps ahead to find the target element.

##### FibonacciSearch:

- Implements Fibonacci search, similar to binary search but dividing the array into Fibonacci numbers.

##### TernarySearch:

- Implements ternary search, dividing the search space into three parts instead of two.

<!-- How to get started -->

## Getting Started

To run the Search Alogorithms Java Program on your local machine, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine one of the following:
   HTTPS: <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/jvang0620/Searching-Algorithms-Java-Program.git</code></pre>
   SSH: <pre><code>git clone git@github.com:jvang0620/Searching-Algorithms-Java-Program.git</code></pre>

2. In the terminal, type `javac MainProgram.java` then press 'enter' to compile your Java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3. Afterward, type `java MainProgram` then click 'enter' to executes the bytecode generated by the compiler using the JVM

4. The program will display in the output. Happy Coding! :)
